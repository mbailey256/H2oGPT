# H2oGPT

Capturing my interactions with the https://gpt.h2o.ai/ against the multiple LLM models with varying parameters.  I found the responses to be interesting and surprises.  


When asked: "Who won the most recent superbowl?"
There was a lot of confusion across the non-openai models on multiple facts for the same model across the different sizes.  

I've included the chat history file "H2o_Superbowl_chat.json" , which you can reload under the Chat History tab.  

Reference: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Bowl_champions

Also, included is a screenshot the the current LLMs used.
